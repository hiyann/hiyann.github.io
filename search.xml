        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Author: Lewis Carroll</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="CHAPTER-I-Down-the-Rabbit-Hole-掉进兔子洞"><a href="#CHAPTER-I-Down-the-Rabbit-Hole-掉进兔子洞" class="headerlink" title="CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole 掉进兔子洞"></a>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole 掉进兔子洞</h2><p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p><p>爱丽丝开始变的非常无聊对于坐在她的姐姐旁边在河岸边，也无聊于无事可做：有一两次她窥视她的姐姐正在阅读的书，但是书里没有图画也没有对话，“那么一本没有图画和对话的书的作用是什么呢？”爱丽丝想。</p><p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain <strong>would be worth the trouble of</strong> getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p><p>所以她在她的脑海里考虑（尽她所能，因为炎热的天气使她感觉是非常困倦的和讨厌的），是否制作一个雏菊链的乐趣能够值得起来和采摘雏菊的麻烦，此时，突然一个有粉红色的眼睛的白兔子向她跑近。</p><p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p><p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p><p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”</p><p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p><p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p><p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p><p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p><p>However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.<br>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”</p><p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!”</p><p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p><p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p><p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>制度和流程的联系和区别，以及在企业管理中的作用。</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="联系"><a href="#联系" class="headerlink" title="联系"></a>联系</h3><p>流程和制度共同点在于：它们都是规范，需要员工来遵守，并由企业的强制力作为保障。</p><h3 id="区别"><a href="#区别" class="headerlink" title="区别"></a>区别</h3><p><strong>第一，流程和制度的表现形态不同。</strong></p><p>流程是显性化的，也可以是非显性化的，而制度只有显性化这一种形态。也就是说，流程描述了的和未被描述了的都是存在的，只要人们有重复性的动作就存在流程，可以说流程在企业中无处不在。可以存在于规范性的文件中，可以存在于人们的行为习惯中，也可以存在于机器设备或者IT系统。制度只能有一种存在形态，那就是正式文本，不在正式文本中的不能称之为制度。如此我们就可以知道，它们的管理范围是不同的，流程管理能够覆盖企业所有的活动，而制度只是用来界定那些我们认为需要订立契约的部分。这样看来，要管“到位”就需要靠流程，不管它是明文规范的还是习惯的，不管是人的活动还是机器或者IT的活动，企业做事最重要的是靠流程。</p><p><strong>第二，流程是连贯的而制度是不连贯的。</strong></p><p>制度的表现形式是条款化的文本，这种文字化的表现方式就决定了它本身是不精确的。比如说我们要订一项制度，应该写多少章、多少节、多少条、多少款是没有规则的。虽然企业里通常会为制度制定规则，但是这些规则只限于制度表达的模式，至于制度的边界、颗粒度、内容和表达语言都是很难定义的，这是由制度的特性决定的。而流程则不同，流程具有精确性，比如流程有五个活动，那就是五个活动，而不是六个或者四个，这是确定的。同时流程具有连贯性，有严格的逻辑顺序。现代企业管理需要精确，能够实现这种精确性的是流程而不是制度。</p><p><strong>第三，流程主要针对活动过程而制度主要针对活动结果。</strong></p><p>流程是做事情的过程，我们需要管理动作，是因为如果动作能够被控制，那么我们相信结果是稳定的。只关注结果的，就会使得做事情的过程容易被各种因素左右，结果也就变得不稳定。管企业就是管人，管人如何做事情。换句话说，我们希望不同的人做相同的事情有相同的结果，尽可能地消除经验或者责任心带来的影响，这样我们就需要通过流程来规范动作，让结果保持稳定。</p><p><strong>第四，流程可以整合很多管理维度和方法而制度不能。</strong></p><p>所有的管理维度和方法最终都需要落实到活动中去。流程能够承载很多的管理功能，基于流程可以进行组织管理和职责分配，可以进行业务模式的设计，可以整合质量、风险内控、绩效管理等很多管理维度和体系，可以支持IT规划和开发。这是流程的特性，而制度不具备这些的功能。</p><h3 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h3><p>基于以上流程和制度的区别和联系，所以我们要用流程管理来代替制度管理成为运营管理规则的主角。但是我们要清楚的一点是，这并不表示流程要取代制度，这是两回事。通常我们用流程定义了人们做事情的路径，还需要对做事情提出相应的要求，制度便具备这样的功能，也就是流程是一条一条的路径，而制度是路径们的边界。</p><mark class="tag-plugin mark" color="dark">就像是在开车，流程是一条条的道路和路牌，让你知道该怎么走，而制度是道路的边界，最好不要把车开出道路，否则会受到相应的惩罚。</mark>所以最好的方式是制度和流程相互匹配、相互融合，进而形成一套完整的运营手册。]]></content>
