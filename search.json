Down the Rabbit-Hole 掉进兔子洞\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”\n\n爱丽丝开始变的非常无聊对于坐在她的姐姐旁边在河岸边，也无聊于无事可做：有一两次她窥视她的姐姐正在阅读的书，但是书里没有图画也没有对话，“那么一本没有图画和对话的书的作用是什么呢？”爱丽丝想。\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain **would be worth the trouble of** getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\n所以她在她的脑海里考虑（尽她所能，因为炎热的天气使她感觉是非常困倦的和讨厌的），是否制作一个雏菊链的乐趣能够值得起来和采摘雏菊的麻烦，此时，突然一个有粉红色的眼睛的白兔子向她跑近。\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!”\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.","tags":["fiction"],"categories":["小说"]},{"title":"新增主题深色/浅色切换功能","path":"/2025/09/11/主题深色-浅色切换/","content":"在主页添加主题颜色切换按钮\n<!-- more -->\n## 1.

variable）组成。- 观察变量是用量表或问卷等的测量工具得到的数据；- 潜在变量是观察变量间所形成的特质或抽象概念。在结构方程模型（structural equation modeling，SEM）中，- 观察变量通常以**长方形**符号表示；潜在变量（构念construct）通常以**椭圆形**符号表示；- 一个潜在变量必须以 **≥3个** 的观察变量来估计，称为多元指标原则。- 观察变量是潜在变量的**反应性指标**，也就是果指标（effect indicators）。{% note color:blue 核心区别**反应性指标**（Reflective Indicators）：是被潜在变量影响的结果，指标变化反映变量变化（如“满意度”是变量，“推荐意愿”“重复购买”是其反应性指标，满意度高则指标表现好，指标可以少，不影响潜变量的内涵，指标间高度正相关）。 **形成性指标**（Formative Indicators）：是构成潜在变量的原因，指标组合定义变量（如“生活质量”是变量，“收入”“健康”“社交”是其形成性指标，这些指标共同决定生活质量高低,不能少指标，要不潜变量的内涵就变了，指标间可以不相关甚至负相关）。%}在amos测量模型中，需要有一个测量指标的路径系数 λ 固定为 1 ，否则测量模型无法估计。测量模型在SEM的模型中就是一般所谓的验证性因子分析（confirmatory factor analysis，CFA），用于检验模型中各指标和构念的聚合效度以及区别效度。初始假定误差项之间是独立无关的，cfa分析中会提供修正指标值，提示相关关系。聚合效度和区别效度均为验证性因子分析（CFA） 中评估量表结构效度的核心指标，用于检验测量工具是否能准确测量目标概念。1. 聚合效度（Convergent Validity）- 核心定义：同一概念（潜变量）下的不同测量题项（观测变量），应高度相关并共同指向该概念，即“同属一个概念的题项应聚合在一起”。- 判断标准：通常通过平均方差提取值（AVE） 评估，一般要求AVE值≥0.5，表明该潜变量能解释其观测变量至少50%的方差，聚合效果良好。- 示例：测量“客户满意度”的3个题项（如“我对服务很满意”“我愿意再次选择该服务”“我认为服务超出预期”），若它们的AVE≥0.5，说明这3个题项有效聚合，共同测量了“客户满意度”。2. 区别效度（Discriminant Validity）- 核心定义：不同概念（潜变量）的测量题项之间，应呈现较低的相关性，即“不同概念的题项应相互区分开”，避免测量重叠。- 判断标准：常用两种方法： 1. 一个潜变量的AVE平方根，应大于该潜变量与其他所有潜变量的相关系数（最常用标准）。 2. 两个不同潜变量的测量题项，其组内相关系数（ICC）应显著低于组间相关系数。- 示例：同时测量“客户满意度”和“品牌忠诚度”，若“客户满意度”的AVE平方根（如0.75）大于它与“品牌忠诚度”的相关系数（如0.60），则说明两者测量边界清晰，区别效度达标。3.

语态\n语态分为两个：主动，被动。\n\n下表详细列出了语式和时态相结合后的情形：\n\n| 语式/时态 | 直陈      |    虚拟  |    条件  |   命令  |   不定  |   分词  |   最近  |\n| --------- | --------  | ------- | ------- |------- |------- |------- |------- |\n|

-ant\n\n2, 运用\n\nNous avons besoin d'un employé <u>connaissant</u> la situation du marché. \n我们想要一个员工，他了解市场行情。\n- connaissant 这里表修饰。本质上是一个动词，用来修饰这个员工，没有人称和性数变化。\n\n<u>Ayant</u> peu d'argent，il a volé une moto. \n因为没有钱，所以他偷了一辆摩托车。\n- ayant 这里表原因。\n\n<u>Sortant</u> de la banque, j'ai renconté mon bère.\n从银行出来时，我遇见了我爸。\n- sortant 这里表时间。\n\nIl pourait mieux aller <u>prenant</u> un autre cours. \n如果采取另一条路，事情可能会进行的更好。\n- prenant 这里表条件。\n\n<u>Ayant</u> envie de voyager, il n'a pas d'argent.\n虽然他想旅行，但是他没钱。\n- ayant 这里表让步。\n\nIl ouvrit la porte, <u>entrant</u> dans la clinique. \n他打开门，走进诊所。\n- entrant 这里表并列。\n\nLa pluie ne <u>cessant</u> pas，j'ai décidé de rester à la maison. \n雨没有停，我决定待在家里。\n- cessant 独立分词从句，有自己的主语。\n\nLa résolution <u>étant</u> prise, nous n'avons qu'à l'exécuter.\n决议已经被做出，我们只好执行。\n- étant prise 现在分词被动态在独立分词从句中经常使用。\n- avoir à faire 有事必须要做\n\n\n\n#### 过去分词\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 复合过去分词\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 副动词\n1, 构成\n\nen + 现在分词，但 ayant 和 étant 前不加 en\n\n2, 运用\n\n副动词修饰主句的谓语，位置不定，只有主动概念，表示和主句谓语同时发生的动作，施动者为主句主语，无性数变化。\n\nTu te fatiqueras **en courant** comme ça. \n你这么跑会累的。\n- 表原因。\n\nLes enfants gambadent en sortant de l'école.\n孩子们蹦蹦跳跳在出学校时。\n- 表时间。\n\n- 表条件、假设\n- 表方式、方法\n- 表对立、让步\n\n副动词前加上 tout ，能够强调时间的同时性或者对立、让步。\n\nIl fuit **tout en criant au secours**. \n他一边跑，一边喊救命。\n- fuir 逃跑\n\n\n\n\n#### 动形容词\n一些现在分词已经转化为形容词，并和形容词一样有性数变化, 我们称动形容词。\n- des livres **intéressants** 有趣的书\n- la femme **souriante** 微笑着的女人\n- des enfants **obéissants** 听话的孩子\n- un jeu **amusant** 有趣的游戏\n\n需要注意的是，有些动形容词的词形并不与现在分词一样。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### faire / laisser + inf.\n\n#### faire + inf.\n\nfaire + inf. 表意是 让 / 使得 某人做某事，不管他意愿如何。 \n\nJe fais venir **les étudiants**.  我让学生们来。\n- venir 是不及物动词，后边直接加施动者，不需要加介词。\n\nJ‘ai fait manger des légumes **aux** enfants. 我让孩子们吃些蔬菜。\n- manger 是及物动词，这时候再加施动者需要用到介词 à 。\n\nLe propriétaire a fait repeindre le mur **par** un artiste.  房主要求一位艺术家重新绘制墙面。\n- repeindre 是及物动词，这时候再加施动者需要用到介词 par 。\n\nJe fait écrire une lettre **par** Pierre. 我让皮埃尔写一封信。\n- écrire 是及物动词，并且这里用介词 à 会产生歧义，所以用 par 。\n\nJe les ai fait manger. 我让他们吃饭。\n- manger 表示吃饭的时候是不及物动词，用人称代词代替施动者时使用 **直宾**，并放在助动词前，此结构下过去分词 fait 无性数变化。\n\nJe leur ai fait manger des légumes. 我让他们吃点蔬菜。\n- manger 表示吃点什么东西的时候是及物动词，因为后边跟着直接宾语，所以用人称代词代替施动者时使用 **间宾**，并放在助动词前。\n\nLe propriétaire **le lui** a fait repeindre. 房主让他重绘它（墙）。\n- 用 **直宾** 代替直接宾语，用 **间宾** 代替施动者。\n\n回忆多个代词位置\n- me te se nous vous \n- le la les\n- lui leur\n- y\n- en\n\n\nil **s'est fait couper** les cheveux par le meilleur coiffeur de Paris. 他让自己的头发被修剪，通过法国最好的理发师。\n- se faire + inf. 表达的意思是 让自己的东西被怎样。这里的复合过去表完成。\n\n#### laisser + inf.\n\nlaisser + inf. 表意是 让 / 任凭 某人做其想做的事。\n\nJe laisse entrer le chat **par** le fenêtre. 我让猫从窗户进来。\n\nIl se laisse guider par son instinct. 他任凭自己被自己的直觉指引。\n- se laisser + inf. 表达 任凭自己被···。\n\n\n\n### 简单过去时\n\n一个口语里不常用的直陈式（语式）中的时态。\n① 描述很久很久之前的动作\n② 动作是完成的\n③ 见于文学作品、神话、传记和小说\n\n#### 1. 变位 la conjugaison\n\n直接看例子\n\n| 序号 | inf.     |
